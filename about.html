                    <p>I'm fortunate to live in Canada. I love it's landscape for countless reasons. I live in a beautiful part of the country, the Georgian Bay area. Many of my images...waves, rainbows, sand, sailing, winter, trees, leaves, sunsets, animals and winter scenes are taken from my backyard, truly a gift from Mother Nature.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although I love my home, I like to explore new countries - cities, villages and their surrounding landscapes. I'm intrigued by the shops, the alleys, the architecture, the beaches, the gardens, the mountains, and the forests of all the places I visit.</p>
                    
                    <p>Join me on my journeys. Appreciate life as I do, as a visual experience. Come with me with camera in hand, as I slow down and truly observe. Together, we see the little things, the small details that make our world a beautiful and fascinating place.</p>
                    
                    <p>I invite you to see the world through my lens. You will travel to distant lands as well as view familiar everyday scenes you might overlook. Hopefully, you will see something new, something unexpected, a little surprise that you may have missed.</p>
