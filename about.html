                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I'm fortunate to live in Canada. I love it's landscape for countless reasons. I live in a beautiful part of the country, the Georgian Bay area. Many of my images...waves, rainbows, sand, sailing, winter, trees, leaves, sunsets, animals and winter scenes are taken from my backyard, truly a gift from Mother Nature.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although I love my home, I like to explore new countries - cities, villages and their surrounding landscapes. I'm intrigued by the shops, the alleys, the architecture, the beaches, the gardens, the mountains, and the forests of all the places I visit.</p>
                    
                    <p>Join me on my journeys. Appreciate life as I do, as a visual experience. Come with me with camera in hand, as I slow down and truly observe. Together, we see the little things, the small details that make our world a beautiful and fascinating place.</p>
                    
                    <p>I invite you to see the world through my lens. You will travel to distant lands as well as view familiar everyday scenes you might overlook. Hopefully, you will see something new, something unexpected, a little surprise that you may have missed.</p>

                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I believe every home, office, living space, needs art. Photography is an affordable art form. When you decorate your home you can easily find an original piece that reflects your personality. Choosing an appealing abstract, or landscape expresses who you are.</p>

                    <p>If we travelled to the same places perhaps I've captured an image that brings back wonderful memories. Imagine the mood or feeling you want in each room in your home and the art, which inspires that feeling.</p>

                    <p>If you're an outdoor person or one drawn to Nature, perhaps, one of my photos from Mother Earth will bring a peaceful, tranquil mood to your space.</p>

                    <p>Art can be a conversation starter or inspire or challenges us. Seeing others doing what they love may inspire you to take your own risks.</p>

                    <p>Your home is your personal space, your sanctuary. Choose what attracts you - an image that evokes comfort, excitement or inspiration.</p>

                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Art acts as a focal point. It adds a finishing touch to your space. A canvas or series of prints ready to be framed might be the perfect accent to warm up or enliven your room. If you need help choosing size/scale, or are looking for a particular subject or color, please contact me and I'll be happy to help.</p>

                    <p>I also create blank photo greeting cards. Often, when searching for the right card for that special person, the words in the card do not reflect your words, your voice. With a blank photo greeting card you choose an image that fits the sentiment and you write your own heartfelt words.</p>
